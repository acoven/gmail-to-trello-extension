I have four active in-app purchasable SKUs that I have never coded up or used, can you delete them completely?

I was experimenting with having in-app purchases a couple years ago, and I believe their presence is now making it impossible for me to publish updates to my Chrome Extension (that has always been free and we've never charged for it.)

Here's the in-app purchase skus that can be completely deleted:

Gmail-to-Trello Yearly Subscription $19.99 (gmail_to_trello_yearly_subscription_19_99)  $19.99  6/27/17 Active
Gmail-to-Trello Yearly Subscription $29.99 (gmail_to_trello_yearly_subscription_29_99)  $29.99  6/27/17 Active
Gmail-to-Trello Yearly Subscription $0.99 (gmail_to_trello_yearly_subscription_99cents) $0.99   6/27/17 Active
Gmail-to-Trello Yearly Subscription $9.99 (gmail_to_trello_yearly_subscription_9_99)    $9.99   6/27/17 Active

Can you help?
