### We Are an Extension
Gmail-to-Trello is only an Extension for the Chrome web browser. It is only useful in the Chrome web browser, and you must have Gmail and Trello accounts for this to be of maximum use. We are not affiliated with Google or Trello. We are just a Chrome Extension. Nothing more. Really. No foolin. And yet we still must specify this additional legaleze...
.

### Software Downloads Are Controlled by Google
The Chrome Web Store automatically generates anonymatized data regarding downloads of this extension. Once this extension is installed, it connects automatically to the Chrome Web Store to determine if updated versions are available, and generate anonymatized usage analytics using Google Analytics collection. All interactions with the Chrome Web Store, Google, and other third-parties are governed by their privacy policies.
.

### Bug Reports Can Be Submitted on Our Trello Board
You have the option to submit bug reports to us when an error occurs. If you choose to submit reports via the [Gmail-to-Trello Extension Trello site](https://trello.com/b/CGU9BYgd/gmail-to-trello-extension), the content of those reports will be available to the project developers and other customers, which may include third parties. We may disclose the information in the report to people as necessary to improve the software.
.

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in a Gmail Will Be Transferred to Trello
We use Chrome's standard storage mechanisms to restore settings, drop-downs state, and provide automation of features. Unless it is part of those items, we do not store personally identifiable information in the Extension. Any information collected from Gmail is shown in our window. That information is then transferred to Trello via the Trello APIs and is governed by Trello's Privacy Policy.
.
### Transmission Security Based on Trello API Governance
We use Trello’s APIs to transfer data from Gmail to Trello. We use best efforts to follow their prescribed best practice patterns. The security and/or encryption of the data transmitted is therefore governed by the security and/or encryption present in the Trello-prescribed best pattern  usage of Trello’s APIs implementation.

### Use of Information Only for Improving
In general, we use the information provided by you to make Gmail-to-Trello better.
.

### Disclosure of Your Information Only by Your Consent or by Legal Edict
We may be required to disclose information about you to third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; or (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order.

If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, and we are not legally prevented from doing so, we will attempt to provide you with notice of the disclosure.
.

### Security is Not Implied and is Your Responsibility
We do not store any information collected in any system besides the [Gmail-to-Trello Extension Trello site](https://trello.com/b/CGU9BYgd/gmail-to-trello-extension). Your Gmail and Trello accounts are owned by you and are your responsibility. We cannot guarantee their security.
